# User Cart Management System (Python, SQLite, Tkinter):

Built a cart management system using Python and Tkinter, featuring a user-friendly interface to select fruits, enter quantities, view dynamically calculated bills with current date and time, and reset inputs using a “Clear All” button.

Used SQLite to store and manage inventory data (fruit name, actual price, and stock capped at 50 kg), updating records in real time based on user purchases

# Daily-Market-Billing-System (Python, SQLite, Tkinter):

Built a simple billing app for a fruit shop using Python, with a user-friendly interface made in Tkinter.

Used SQLite to store fruit names, prices (based on Haryana market), and available quantity (up to 50 kg per fruit).

The app calculates the total bill based on selected fruits and quantity, and shows the current date and time on the bill.

Added a "Clear All" button to reset selections easily and made sure the app is easy to use and beginner-friendly.
